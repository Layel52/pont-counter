<h1 align="center">Point Counter</h1>
</br>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>One day when my friend played a game we loved, he said, "This game mode is insane, but I can't count my points", so... here we are.</p>
</br>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The application must be able to have the final balance of the day's matches, win rate of each character used and finally, the main rival of the day.</br></br>
The user must select between the option of victory and defeat, select the character used in the game and inform the nick of the opponent.</p>
